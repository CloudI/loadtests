# CloudI Loadtest Results

Large binary files are stored here that provide the raw output from
loadtesting [CloudI](https://github.com/CloudI/CloudI/tree/develop/src).
The directory structure mimics the main CloudI source code repository
organization.

For summarized information, [go here](https://cloudi.org/faq.html#5_LoadTesting).

Currently, only Tsung loadtest results from CloudI =< 1.5.1 are in this
repository.  More recent results are available from usage of the
[`cloudi_service_request_rate` service in the main repository](https://github.com/CloudI/CloudI/tree/develop/src/lib/cloudi_service_request_rate/results).
